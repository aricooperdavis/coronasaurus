# Executive Summary
<b>The COVID19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown affected every person and household in the United Kingdom. Work, social habits, family relationships, leisure activities. In fact, absolutely everything was suddenly different, and these dramatic changes had a major impact on the economy, environment and society as a whole. By examining these changes, as captured by publicly available data, we have identified multiple trends and preliminary lessons, which could be employed to tackle the even greater looming crisis of Climate Change. Whilst there will be many more building blocks in an all-encompassing solution, the primary theme, examined by Team Coronasaurus, was the changing work patterns - embracing the art of home working - which achieved a reduction in UK CO2 emmissions by 30%.</b>

## Introduction
The unprecedented global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in huge population behavioural changes; from the cessation of travel to a transition to remote working. We don't often see changes of this magnitude, which offers researchers the unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of lockdown measures.

One particular area of interest is the impact on greenhouse gas emissions. As a signatory of the Paris Agreement the UK has a responsibility to limit the global average temperature rise to below 2&deg;C, but this is an ambitious task! Can we use data from this event to evaluate the sort of changes that might need to be made to meet these climate goals?

## The brief
[![alt text](https://i2.wp.com/digitalenvironment.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/covid-19_banner-800.png?w=800&ssl=1)](https://digitalenvironment.org/home/covid-19-digital-sprint-hackathons/)

This is an entry for [COVID-19 Hackathon 2: Recovery](https://digitalenvironment.org/home/covid-19-digital-sprint-hackathons/covid-19-hackathon-2-recovery/), run by the Natural Environment Research Council on behalf of UKRI. The brief is:

> - What are the positive and negative aspects of lockdown and recovery measures on meeting Paris and net zero targets?
> - Using multivariate signals to highlight these impacts and their inter-relationships to inform decision making.
>
> Multivariate signals and their interrelationships can be used to highlight the path to recovery. The pandemic is essentially a large unplanned experiment, allowing us to consider the ex-ante/mid-post/ex-post aspects of the effectiveness of the lockdown measures. It further allows us to study the positive and negative aspects of lockdown behaviours and to differentiate between the two. It can also help us to better understand the challenges associated with reaching the 8% target of the Paris Accord and reaching net zero (lockdown restrictions have currently delivered both a 5% reduction in emissions, and a 14% reduction in GDP). Solutions addressing this theme can draw from a variety of data sources including EO, social media and other potential sources.

### Our Approach

Team Coronasaurus examined the effects of the lockdown, seen through publicly available data (UK government, NERC, etc), to examine the effects of the UK populations changes in lifestyle, living arrangements, social interaction and work patterns both going into and out of lockdown could be "read across" towards long term carbon dioxide reduction and climate change mitigation. The "read across" was examined to answer the question "What climate change effects could be achieved if the UK's working population made changes to their working hours and working location?". 

In short, Team Coronasaurus has been examining if a 4 day working week (with potentially longer days and including 2 days home working) would help reduce UK CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and help mitigate climate change?

### Watch our Presentation
You can [watch our presentation on YouTube](https://youtu.be/s0e5wG3_MOM) where we'll talk through our strategy, the analysis we performed, and the figures we made.

### Interactive notebook
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/aricooperdavis/coronasaurus_NERCHackathonTwo_Multivariate/master?urlpath=%2Ftree%2Fcoronasaurus.ipynb)

You can "play along" online with our analysis using our interactive binder notebook - just click the link above and it'll be served for you. This might take a little while to launch.

Alternatively, if you're in a hurry or want to build on our work, you can download the notebook and run it locally using `jupyter`.

And if you're in a real hurry, don't care about interactivity, and just want to read our report, you can [do so here](https://github.com/aricooperdavis/coronasaurus_NERCHackathonTwo_LearningFromLockdown/blob/master/presentation/Coronasaurus.pdf) (but it's much much better as an interactive notebook!).
